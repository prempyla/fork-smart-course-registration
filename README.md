## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** 18+ (Node 22 recommended)
- **npm** 10+
- **PostgreSQL** 14+ (or Supabase account)
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dingdong-vamshi/forked-smart-course-registration.git
cd forked-smart-course-registration
```

### 2. Backend Setup

#### Install Dependencies
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

#### Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory:

```env
# Database Configuration (PostgreSQL)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/course_registration"

# Server Configuration
PORT=4000
NODE_ENV=development

# JWT Secret (use a strong random string)
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_change_this_in_production

# Frontend URL (for CORS)
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

**Note:** For Supabase PostgreSQL:
- Use the connection pooling URL for `DATABASE_URL`
- Ensure your database is accessible

#### Generate Prisma Client & Run Migrations
```bash
# Generate Prisma Client
npx prisma generate

# Run database migrations
npx prisma migrate dev --name init

# (Optional) Seed database with sample data
npm run seed

# (Optional) Open Prisma Studio to view/edit data
npx prisma studio
```

#### Start Backend Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

The backend will start on `http://localhost:4000`

### 3. Frontend Setup

#### Install Dependencies
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

#### Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/api
```

#### Start Frontend Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will start on `http://localhost:5173`

### 4. Run Both Servers Concurrently

From the root directory:
```bash
npm run dev:all
```

This will start both backend and frontend servers simultaneously.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
```bash
# Find process using port 4000 (backend)
lsof -i :4000

# Find process using port 5173 (frontend)
lsof -i :5173

# Kill the process
kill -9 <PID>

# Or change PORT in backend/.env
```

### Database Connection Issues
- Verify PostgreSQL is running
- Check `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`
- Ensure database exists: `CREATE DATABASE course_registration;`
- Run migrations: `npx prisma migrate dev`
- Check firewall settings if using remote database

### Prisma Issues
```bash
# Reset database (WARNING: Deletes all data)
npx prisma migrate reset

# Regenerate Prisma Client
npx prisma generate

# View database in browser
npx prisma studio
```

### CORS Errors
- Verify `FRONTEND_URL` in backend `.env`
- Check `VITE_API_URL` in frontend `.env`
- Ensure both servers are running
- Clear browser cache

### Authentication Errors
- Check JWT_SECRET is set in backend `.env`
- Verify token is being sent in request headers
- Check token expiration settings
- Clear localStorage and login again

### Enrollment Issues
- Verify student is logged in
- Check section capacity
- Ensure no schedule conflicts
- Check registration deadlines

## Key Features Explained

### Waitlist Automation
When a section reaches capacity:
1. New enrollment attempts automatically join the waitlist
2. Waitlist position is determined by join time (FIFO)
3. When a student drops, the first person in waitlist is automatically enrolled
4. Notification is sent to promoted student

### Conflict Detection
The system checks for:
- **Time conflicts** - Classes at the same time
- **Back-to-back classes** - Insufficient time between classes
- **Room conflicts** - Same room double-booked

### Search Functionality
- **Student Portal** - Search courses in Browse Courses page
- **Faculty Portal** - Search assigned sections
- Real-time filtering as you type
- Searches across course code, title, and section

### Dashboard Analytics
- **Students** - Credits earned, enrolled courses, upcoming classes
- **Faculty** - Total sections, total students, today's schedule
- **Admin** - System-wide enrollment stats, waitlist overview

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd smart-course-registration
```

### 2. Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies.
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following variables:
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DB_NAME?schema=public"
JWT_SECRET="your_super_secret_key"
PORT=4000
```

Run database migrations:
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

npm run dev
```

### 3. Frontend Setup
Open a new terminal, navigate to the frontend directory, and install dependencies.
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

Start the frontend development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Run Both Concurrently
You can also run both servers from the root or frontend directory if configured, but running them in separate terminals is recommended for easier debugging.
